# Carbon Credits Smart Contract

## Project Overview

The Carbon Credits smart contract is designed to create a transparent, secure, and efficient system for issuing, tracking, and trading carbon credits. By leveraging blockchain technology, this contract ensures authenticity and prevents fraud in the carbon credit market through a decentralized marketplace.

### Key Features
- **Issuance Module**: Manages the creation of carbon credit tokens by verified issuers.
- **Verification Module**: Handles the verification process for emissions reductions by third-party verifiers.
- **Marketplace Module**: Facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of carbon credits.
- **Tracking and Reporting Module**: Tracks the status and history of carbon credits.
- **Compliance and Security Module**: Ensures compliance with regulations and implements security measures.

### Prerequisites
- Rust and Cargo installed on your system.
- Familiarity with blockchain concepts and smart contracts.
- Access to the Soroban SDK.

## Setup & Installation

### Dependencies
- Rust (edition 2021)
- Soroban SDK

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   2. Build the project using Cargo:
   
### Deployment Steps
1. Ensure you have the Soroban environment set up.
2. Deploy the contract using Soroban CLI or your preferred deployment tool.

## Usage Guide

### Main Functions and Their Purpose
- **Issuance Module**
  - `create_credit`: Creates a new carbon credit.
  - `authorize_issuer`: Authorizes an issuer to create credits.

- **Verification Module**
  - `verify_project`: Verifies a project for emissions reductions.
  - `record_verification`: Records verification data on the blockchain.

- **Marketplace Module**
  - `buy_credit`: Allows a user to purchase carbon credits.
  - `sell_credit`: Allows a user to list credits for sale.

- **Tracking Module**
  - `retire_credit`: Retires a carbon credit, marking it as used.
  - `get_credit_history`: Retrieves the history of a carbon credit.

- **Compliance Module**
  - `check_compliance`: Checks compliance with specified rules.
  - `enforce_security`: Enforces security measures.

### Common Operations with Examples
- **Creating a Credit**
  
- **Verifying a Project**
  
- **Buying a Credit**
  
## Contract Structure

### Key Files
- **src/lib.rs**: Main entry point for the smart contract.
- **src/issuance.rs**: Manages credit issuance.
- **src/verification.rs**: Handles project verification.
- **src/marketplace.rs**: Facilitates credit trading.
- **src/tracking.rs**: Tracks credit status and history.
- **src/compliance.rs**: Ensures compliance and security.
- **src/types.rs**: Defines common data structures.
- **src/errors.rs**: Defines error handling mechanisms.
- **src/utils.rs**: Provides utility functions.

### Main Components and Their Relationships
- **Issuance and Verification**: Work together to ensure only verified credits are issued.
- **Marketplace and Tracking**: Collaborate to manage credit trading and status updates.
- **Compliance**: Interacts with all modules to enforce rules and security.

## Testing

### How to Run Tests
Run the tests using Cargo:

### Test Coverage Overview
- **Issuance Tests**: Validate credit creation and authorization.
- **Verification Tests**: Ensure proper project verification.
- **Marketplace Tests**: Test buying and selling operations.
- **Tracking Tests**: Verify credit status updates and history retrieval.
- **Compliance Tests**: Check compliance and security enforcement.

## Security Considerations
- Implement role-based access control to prevent unauthorized actions.
- Use blockchain's immutability to secure transaction records.

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Verify that the Soroban environment is properly configured.
- Check error messages for guidance on resolving issues.
